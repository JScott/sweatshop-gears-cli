# sweatshop-gears-cli

Package management for [Robot Sweatshop](https://github.com/JScott/robot_sweatshop) scripts.

`sweatshop gears install <package-name>`

If you can't create `/usr/local/gears`, use the `--path` flag to install everything to somewhere you can.

## Future

- Figure out something sane for finding ports for services
- Source from custom repo
