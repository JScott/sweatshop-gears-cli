# sweatshop-gears-cli

Package management for [Robot Sweatshop](https://github.com/JScott/robot_sweatshop) scripts.

## Usage

`sweatshop gears install <package-name>`

If you can't create `/usr/local/gears`, use the `--path` flag to install everything to somewhere you can.

## What packages?

Right now it only supports pulling from the [official repository](https://github.com/JScott/sweatshop-gears-packages). The plan is to support 3rd party repositories of scripts in the future.
